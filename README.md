# NBFrameWork
## Introduction

NB Framework is a simple application framework for PHP web apps, that helps separate design and logic, and, in conjunction with associated code wizards, makes development of applications that combine web-forms, databases and/or XML serialization very quick.

The core of the framework avoids any external dependencies, and uses very standard PHP and JavaScript to ensure that code is easily understandable. One of the key design intentions was to create a framework for highly maintainable applications, which did not require maintainers to spend time learning to understand the framework before they could update applications. The framework also tries to avoid any requirement to include bloated or unused code within an application.

Developers who wish to make use of common libraries such as jQuery, or make use of Bootstrap CSS to create the user interface will find this straightforward, however no external libraries are required.
